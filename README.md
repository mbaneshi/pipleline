## **Pipeline**

This project is designed to create a web application using **Django REST Framework**, **Next.js**, and **LangChain** that processes code, summarizes it, and generates video content (or other media types) based on the code. The app utilizes **OpenAI models** for language processing and is containerized with **Docker**.

### **Intention**

The goal is to build a system that takes code as input, processes it using **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, and then generates summaries and related media outputs (audio, images, videos). The system should:

1. Receive code from the user.
2. Process the code to generate a summary.
3. Convert the summary into different media forms, such as audio or video.
4. Use **LangChain** to orchestrate multiple AI models and tools to achieve this goal.

### **Technology Stack**

- **Backend**: Django REST Framework
- **Frontend**: Next.js
- **AI Processing**: LangChain
- **Containerization**: Docker

### **Phases**

1. **Phase 1: Backend Setup with Django REST Framework and Docker**
   - Create the core API using Django REST Framework.
   - Set up Docker to run the application in a containerized environment.
   - Integrate LangChain for handling code processing.

2. **Phase 2: Integrate LLMs**
   - Use OpenAI API for language processing and code summarization.
   - Manage memory and context within LangChain for more effective interactions.

3. **Phase 3: Media Generation**
   - Generate media (audio, video) based on the code summary using external libraries or APIs.
   - Develop pipelines for media generation.

4. **Phase 4: Deployment and Scaling**
   - Use Docker and Kubernetes for scaling the application.
   - Set up CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment.

### **Procedure**

#### 1. **Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mbaneshi/pipeline.git
cd pipeline
```

#### 2. **Set up environment:**

- Make sure to have **Docker**, **Python 3.10**, and **Node.js** installed on your system.
- Create a virtual environment and install the backend dependencies:

  ```bash
  python -m venv venv
  source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
  pip install -r backend/requirements.txt
  ```

- Navigate to the frontend directory and install dependencies:

  ```bash
  cd frontend
  npm install
  ```

#### 3. **Run the project with Docker:**

- For the backend:

```bash
cd backend
docker build -t llm-backend .
docker run -d -p 8000:8000 llm-backend
```

- For the frontend (make sure to run this in a different terminal):

```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

#### 4. **API Documentation:**

- Once the backend app is running, visit `http://localhost:8000/docs` to explore the Django REST Framework auto-generated documentation for your endpoints.

#### 5. **Environment variables:**

Create a `.env` file in the backend directory with your API keys and configuration:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
```

#### 6. **Interacting with the API:**

- Send POST requests to the appropriate endpoint to process and summarize code.

### **Phase Development**

1. **Phase 1** - Initial setup, API with Django REST Framework, and basic Docker configuration.
2. **Phase 2** - Integration of LangChain and OpenAI for processing code input.
3. **Phase 3** - Media generation pipelines, including audio and video generation.
4. **Phase 4** - Deployment, scaling, and CI/CD pipeline setup.

---

### **Future Plans**

- Improve code understanding using advanced LLMs.
- Enhance media generation to support more formats (e.g., video with animations).
- Add a user interface for code input and summary retrieval.
